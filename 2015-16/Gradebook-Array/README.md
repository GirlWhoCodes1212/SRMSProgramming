##Instructions
Oh no, your english teacher has lost their gradebook! They have asked you to 
write a program which allows them to input 7 grades for a student. The 
program must store the grades and compute the mean (average) of the grades 
and output it to the teacher.

##Requirements
- Store the 7 grades in an array and initialize them all to 100
- Write one function to calculate the average by passing the sum of the grades as an input
- Use loops to input the grades

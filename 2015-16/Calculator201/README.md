#Calculator Project Instructions
Task at hand: 

You are working diligently on your math homework after you forgot about it last time when your calculator runs out of batteries. 
However you do not freak out because you know you have your laptop and Netbeans. You decide to write a C++ program that simulates 
a simple calculator.

You have to create a program that:
- Has four functions
- Addition of Three Numbers
- Subtraction of Three Numbers
- Multiplication of Three Numbers
- Division of Two Numbers
- Stores the inputs into an array of 3 numbers
- Outputs the values of the inputs again
- Outputs the values of the functions

**Hints: Do NOT use a loop to store these results! Manually store them. And Store the values as floats/doubles so you can include 
decimals!

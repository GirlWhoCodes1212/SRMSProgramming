- If you want to test it, make an account on projecteuler 
- Remember the process we went over on how to solve problems using programming
  1. Determine how you would solve a smaller version on paper (in detailed steps)
  2. Figure out what elements of code you would need (loops, conditionals, etc.)
  3. Write the basic program out on paper to determine how you should structure it
  4. Test the code
